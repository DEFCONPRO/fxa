# Fixtures

Fixtures make writing tests nicer so that they have less boilerplate.

## Standard

The standard fixure provides

- `target`: the [Target](../targets/README.md) object
- `credentials`: provides the `email` and `password` of a fresh account created and logged in for each test
- `pages`: the set of all Page Object Models defined in `pages/index.ts`
